    The [`Buffer`](/pkg/bytes/#Buffer) type
    has two new methods:
    [`Available`](/pkg/bytes/#Buffer.Available)
    and [`AvailableBuffer`](/pkg/bytes/#Buffer.AvailableBuffer).
    These may be used along with the
    [`Write`](/pkg/bytes/#Buffer.Write)
    method to append directly to the `Buffer`.
