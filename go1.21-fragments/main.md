## Introduction to Go 1.21 {#introduction}

The latest Go release, version 1.21, arrives six months after [Go 1.20](/doc/go1.20).
Most of its changes are in the implementation of the toolchain, runtime, and libraries.
As always, the release maintains the Go 1 [promise of compatibility](/doc/go1compat);
in fact, Go 1.21 [improves upon that promise](#tools).
We expect almost all Go programs to continue to compile and run as before.
