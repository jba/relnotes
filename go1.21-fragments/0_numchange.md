## Introduction to Go 1.21

<!-- https://go.dev/issue/57631 -->
Go 1.21 introduces a small change to the numbering of releases.
In the past, we used Go 1._N_ to refer to both the overall Go language version and release family
as well as the first release in that family.
Starting in Go 1.21, the first release is now Go 1._N_.0.
Today we are releasing both the Go 1.21 language and its initial implementation, the Go 1.21.0 release.
These notes refer to “Go 1.21”; tools like `go` `version` will report “`go1.21.0`”
(until you upgrade to Go 1.21.1).
See “[Go versions](/doc/toolchain#version)” in the “Go Toolchains” documentation for details
about the new version numbering.
